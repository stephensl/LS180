# Creating Database Diagrams

## Level of abstraction

### Conceptual
  - higher level concepts
  - data in abstract way
  - focus on identifying entities and their relationships
  - not concerned with how data or relationships stored in database/relations

### Logical
  - mix of two
  - list of attributes and data types
  - not necessarily related to specific database
  - more detail than conceptual, but not as specific as physical.

### Physical
  - concerned primarily with implementation details
  - all different attributes entity can hold
  - rules about how entities and their attributes relate to each other
