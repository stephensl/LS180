# Relational Data

Data is persisted in a set of **relations**

## Relations are tables. 
  - set of columns and rows of data.


### Relation vs Relationship

Relationship
  - connection between entity instances or rows of data
    - usually resulting from what the data represent. 
  - ex. row in customers table may have *relationship* with zero or more rows in an orders table.

Relation
  - usually another way to say table 
    - whereas a relationship is the association between data stored in those relations.
